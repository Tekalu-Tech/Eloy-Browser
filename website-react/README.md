Eloy Website (React)

This is a minimal Vite + React scaffold for the Eloy Browser website.

Quick start:

1. Copy `Website/LogoMain.png` into `website-react/public/LogoMain.png` so the header logo loads.
2. cd website-react
3. npm install
4. npm run dev

Files created:
- package.json, index.html
- src/main.jsx, src/index.css, src/App.jsx
- src/components/Header.jsx, DownloadSection.jsx, Message.jsx, MembershipSection.jsx

Notes:
- This is intentionally minimal; expand components or add routing as needed.
- To build: `npm run build` and serve `dist` files.

## What is this?

IDK, I'm making a cool browser based on LibreWolf. The goal? Remove the bloat, keep it simple, and make browsing fast and private.

It's just a little project, but if you're into minimal browsers with good privacy, you might like it.

**The idea:**
- No telemetry or tracking stuff
- Fast and lightweight
- Based on LibreWolf (which is already pretty good)
- Just a browser, nothing fancy

## What's different?

- No tracking or telemetry
- Faster than your average bloated browser
- Clean interface (no unnecessary buttons everywhere)
- All the LibreWolf privacy features
- Actually lightweight

## Download

Alpha builds are in the [`EloyAlphaBuilds`](EloyAlphaBuilds/) folder. These are early versions, so expect some bugs.

Check [System Requirements](System%20Requirements.md) to see if your system can run it.

## Building it yourself

The source code is in `EloyAlphaBuilds/librewolf-source/`

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Tekalu-Tech/Eloy-Browser.git
cd Eloy-Browser

# Go to the source
cd EloyAlphaBuilds/librewolf-source

# Build it (you'll need the usual browser build tools)
# Follow LibreWolf's build instructions
```

You'll need the standard browser build tools (Git, Python, etc.). It's basically the same as building LibreWolf.

## Current Status

It's in alpha. Things might break. Don't rely on it for anything critical yet.
